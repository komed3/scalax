/**
 * scalax - Scale Utility Library
 * 
 * This module serves as the main entry point for the scalax library, providing
 * unified access to various scale classes for numerical data transformation and
 * visualization.
 * 
 * The scalax library offers flexible and extensible scale types, including:
 * 
 * - LinearScale:      For evenly spaced, linear numeric scales.
 * - RadialScale:      For circular or angular scales, such as those used in
 *                     polar charts.
 * 
 * Each scale type supports configuration of bounds, tick calculation, precision,
 * and other features required for charting, plotting, or data normalization.
